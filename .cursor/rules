name: iOS Native App Guidelines
description: |
  Use Swift 5+ and SwiftUI to build a native iOS application.
  Follow Apple's iOS 17 Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).
  Favor native Apple components, views, and transitions.

rules:
  - Use Swift 5.9+ and SwiftUI for all interface development.
  - Follow Apple's iOS 17 Human Interface Guidelines for layout, navigation, and visual style.
  - Use native SwiftUI controls unless Apple's frameworks cannot meet the design intent.
  - Avoid third-party libraries unless explicitly allowed or required.
  - Structure code using MVVM architecture with clearly separated responsibilities.
  - Group related views, view models, and models into logical folders.
  - Use semantic system colors (e.g., `.primary`, `.background`) and dynamic type fonts.
  - Apply accessibility modifiers to all views and interactive elements.
  - Add inline comments where logic or naming decisions might be unclear.
  - Ask before implementing navigation structure, routing, or state management logic.
  - Do not hardcode sizes, colors, or fonts â€” follow system conventions.
