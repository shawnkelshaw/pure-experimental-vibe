This document defines the design and development expectations for this app, which targets iOS 26 (public beta of iOS 18), using SwiftUI and Appleâ€™s native iOS UI components.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Intent

This is a native iOS application using only Appleâ€™s official SwiftUI controls, built to comply with the latest Human Interface Guidelines and optimized for the Liquid Glass UI introduced in iOS 26.
	â€¢	Use Apple-native layout patterns â€” no custom navigation or component libraries
	â€¢	Prioritize clarity, depth, deference, and accessibility
	â€¢	Incorporate Liquid Glass styling using .glassBackgroundEffect() where appropriate
	â€¢	Target iPhone 16 Pro layout (393x852) as default preview resolution
	â€¢	Respect all system standards for font scaling, semantic colors, and material rendering
	â€¢	Use semantic text styles and accessibility modifiers (e.g., accessibilityLabel)
	â€¢	Use the entire available set of Apple-native SwiftUI components where applicable â€” including but not limited to TabView, List, Form, NavigationStack, Chart, Map, Gauge, Picker, and others

ðŸ§­ Core Principles

Appleâ€™s design language follows three key principles:
	â€¢	Clarity â€“ Interfaces are precise and easy to understand
	â€¢	Deference â€“ UI supports the content without overpowering it
	â€¢	Depth â€“ Transitions and visual hierarchy reinforce navigation and context

ðŸ§± Layout & Navigation

ðŸ“± Adaptive Layout Requirements
	â€¢	All views must adapt seamlessly to both portrait and landscape orientations
	â€¢	Support compact and regular size classes â€” especially when transitioning between iPhone and iPad
	â€¢	Use SwiftUIâ€™s layout system (GeometryReader, .containerRelativeFrame(), adaptiveStack, etc.) to avoid fixed positioning
	â€¢	Test across devices (e.g., iPhone 16 Pro, iPad Air, iPad Mini) in both orientations to ensure consistent spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy
	â€¢	Use SwiftUI-native containers: NavigationStack, TabView, Form, List
	â€¢	Apply system spacing and safe areas using padding(), Spacer(), and .containerRelativeFrame()
	â€¢	Avoid absolute positioning or fixed frames
	â€¢	Support modal and sheet-based presentation with system transitions
	â€¢	Use adaptive layouts that work in both compact and regular environments

ðŸŽ¨ Visual Style (iOS 26 UI + Liquid Glass)
	â€¢	Use .glassBackgroundEffect() for surfaces and system containers (iOS 26+ only)
	â€¢	Always wrap iOS 26-specific features in:

if #available(iOS 26, *) {
  // iOS 26 UI logic
}



ðŸŒ— Light & Dark Mode Support
	â€¢	All views must support automatic theme switching
	â€¢	Use only semantic colors (.primary, .background, .label, etc.)
	â€¢	Avoid hardcoded Color.white or Color.black
	â€¢	Maintain contrast with subtle border color shifts (~15% opacity) depending on mode
	â€¢	Blur and shadow effects must appear native and consistent across modes

â™¿ Accessibility

ðŸ§± System Spacing Utility

Use the SystemSpacing view for consistent vertical gaps between views. This utility wraps a native Spacer(minLength: 8) to promote semantic spacing aligned with system layout rhythm.

SystemSpacing()

Avoid arbitrary spacing values like .padding(.top, 13) unless explicitly required for alignment or by Appleâ€™s design documentation.
	â€¢	Use Dynamic Type with Text roles like .title2, .body, .caption
	â€¢	Implement accessibilityLabel, accessibilityValue, and accessibilityHint where appropriate
	â€¢	Avoid fixed sizing or positioning that disrupts screen reader behavior

ðŸš« Avoid
	â€¢	Third-party component libraries unless explicitly approved (e.g., Swift Charts is allowed)
	â€¢	Custom shadows or blur that override system behavior
	â€¢	Overuse of ZStack for layout layering
	â€¢	Fixed positioning or hardcoded frame sizes
