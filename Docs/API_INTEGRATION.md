API & Data

The app currently uses a hybrid approach to data and integration:

â¸»

ðŸ§  Backend â€“ Supabase

Supabase serves as the primary data warehouse and authentication provider for the app.
	â€¢	Stores structured data for vehicle profiles, user accounts, and market listings
	â€¢	Enables secure user sign-in/sign-up and session management
	â€¢	Designed to scale with real-time updates and peer-to-peer data resolution

Core Models:
	â€¢	Vehicle
	â€¢	GarageItem
	â€¢	MarketListing
	â€¢	UserProfile

All models support serialization for transmission (e.g., QR code encoding, Bluetooth exchange).

ðŸ§ª Simulated Layers (Prototype Mode)

To support non-production hardware features, the app currently simulates:
	â€¢	Bluetooth Notifications
	â€¢	Local triggers simulate proximity-based notifications between devices
	â€¢	Used to mock discovery and handoff of vehicle passports
	â€¢	QR Code Scanning
	â€¢	Static codes and mock scan responses are used to simulate ownership or listing resolution
	â€¢	Interactions mimic camera-based scanning without requiring AVFoundation setup
	â€¢	Mocked Data
	â€¢	Used where Supabase data is not yet implemented (e.g., test vehicles)
	â€¢	Allows UI to render even when offline or disconnected

â¸»

ðŸ“¦ Persistence & State
	â€¢	Supabase provides remote persistence for all core models
	â€¢	Temporary data (e.g., in-session scanned content or simulation payloads) live in local runtime memory
	â€¢	Local caching for performance is planned but not yet implemented

This document will evolve alongside production integration milestones and should reflect the latest state of server interaction and mock behavior.
